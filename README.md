Intergalactic.fm Radio plugin for XBMC
================================

This plugin provides a simple list of intergalactic.fm radio streams (IFM hereafter)
So far it has been tested under Windows 7 64bit & in Crunchbang Waldorf (Debian Wheezy) 32bit

Installation
------------

Simply download the latest zip file from the downloads page. On XBMC, go to System->Addons->Install from zip file & locate your downloaded zip file.

Download the latest .zip file from the downloads section, and place it into your 'addons' directory of XBMC. 
This will differ between platforms.

For Windows:
```
  %APPDATA%\XBMC\addons (e.g. C:\Program Files\XBMC\addons)
```

For Linux:
```
	~/.xbmc/addons
```

For Mac:
```
	/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons
```

You can alternatively clone this repository & run the even more basic build script (by typing sh build.sh on a terminal) to generate the zip package, if you know what that means & have a UNIX compatible environment.
